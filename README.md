Maintenance
===========
The things I would like to do in my free time require more time than the free time I currently have.
So, due to prioritizing my personal TODO list, I am currently not making any enhancements to this project.
Maybe some day (when I'm retired!) I'll be able to attack the issue list.
Pull requests are welcome, but the time to review and accept them may be slow.
Sorry, and thanks for understanding (if you understand :) ).
